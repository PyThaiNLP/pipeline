# Open Source Pipeline

Do you want to do someting about Thai language from Open Source? Here is the guideline about resource for working with Thai language in your open-source AI project!


## Smart Speakers

For smart speakers task, you want to do:

- Speech-to-text model
- Keyword Spotting (KWS)
- NLU
- Text-to-speech model

### Speech-to-text model

You can use openai whisper mdoel or other model that fine-tuning pretrained model to Thai language. If you want to train your model, you can download Thai speech corpus from [nlpforthai.com/tasks/speech-recognition/](https://nlpforthai.com/tasks/speech-recognition/).

### Keyword Spotting

Thai language have [Gowajee corpus](https://github.com/ekapolc/gowajee_corpus) for Thai smart home by "Gowajee" hotword.

### Text-to-speech

You can use Text-to-speech from [The Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS) project](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/mms) or use Thai open-source model from [nlpforthai.com/tasks/speech-synthesis/](https://nlpforthai.com/tasks/speech-synthesis/).
